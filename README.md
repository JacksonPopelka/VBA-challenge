# VBA-challenge

Hello! This is my module 2 homework assignment "VBA-Challenge".

The first file I have included is the vba file, which is a file used on the example excel file that loops through the information on each worksheet outputting values such as the Ticker for each stock, quarterly change, percent change, and total stock volume. It will then add another set of values that shows the greatest percent increase along with the ticker value and the value calculated from the data, and the the same thing for the greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume. It will do this for all 4 quarters(sheets). 

I have included a backup text file as well with the same exact code if for some reason the example VBA file does not work and you need to manually put the code in.

Finally I have attached 4 screenshots of the results that should be shown from the code provided. These screenshots show results from all 4 sheets.
